# Credit Card Application - AI Coding Instructions

## Project Overview
A credit card application system with separate frontend and backend components.

## Architecture
```
credit-card-apply/
├── backend/    # API server (stack TBD)
├── frontend/   # Web application (stack TBD)
```

## Getting Started
> **Note:** This project is in early setup. Update this section as the tech stack is chosen.

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
# Add setup commands once stack is defined
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
# Add setup commands once stack is defined
```

## Conventions to Establish
As this project develops, document:
- [ ] API contract patterns between frontend and backend
- [ ] Authentication/authorization approach
- [ ] Credit card application workflow states
- [ ] Data validation rules (both client and server-side)
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Testing strategy

## Domain Concepts
Credit card applications typically involve:
- **Application submission** - User data collection and validation
- **Credit check integration** - External service calls
- **Application status tracking** - State machine for approval workflow
- **Document handling** - ID verification, income proof

## Security Considerations
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling requirements
- PCI-DSS compliance considerations for card data
- Secure API communication patterns
